Every once and a while I get this urge to write. I have never really been much of a writer, but I'm looking to change that. A lot has been happening lately in Ryan (my husband) + I's life and I'm going to start documenting it!

The biggest thing that I will be writing about is foster care! We are super excited to start on this journey and as first time parents, I thought it would be interesting to share our journey. I'm writing a different post on this subject about why we are becoming foster parents and some frequently asked questions -- but feel free to send questions my way if you have any!

The second thing that I will be writing about is about technology and how to find your place in the industry! I try to encourage everyone I meet that tech is the place to be. I want to help as much as I can and I realize that not everyone truly understands what the tech industry has to offer. I am currently writing a book on this subject, but I also want to provide a space where I can discuss this topic in an open space!

Some other topics may arise as I go about my year -- but for now I am focusing on those two!

Thanks for following my journey!
